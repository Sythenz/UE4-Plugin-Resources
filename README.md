# About
This repo is just a list of resources I have found when doing research on Slate, and Unreal Engine plugin development. 
Hopefully, this will be useful to some others.

Please pull request any resources you have! If you cannot for whatever reason, feel free to contact me on twitter.

### Note:
Some of the best resources you can find on Slate specifically already exist in Unreal Engine. My go-to method usually is to use
the Widget Reflector ``Window > Developer Tools > Widget Reflector``and then looking for a given slate widget, e.g:
``SPlacementAssetThumbnail``, searching for this across the full UE4 solution.

Alternatively, if it's really some specific area of the editor, search the solution for whats on screen. E.g:
``"World Outliner"`` or ``"Blueprint\Add Script"`` - ensuring to add the quotations, as you're searching for a string 
as a starting point.

Hope that tip helps too!
